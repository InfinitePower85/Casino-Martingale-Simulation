This is a simple martingale strategy simulation

Basically, start with an initial bet, and double your bet every time you lose. 
Eventually, you will win, make your money back and have a net gain of your initial bet. 

Obviously this arbitrage is too OP for the real world, so casinos use 
max bets to stop this strategy from guarenteed money, typically capping at $500. 

In addition, depending on the style of roulette you play, the chance of doubling your money is slightly lower 
than 50/50. For example, in American-style roulette, there are 2 zero spaces which result in a loss for 
everyone but the house. Thus, your chance of winning is 18/38.

As you might imagine, the more rounds you play, the higher the guarentee that you lose money. 
Even if you start with a low initial amount, such as $2, the losses can mount rather quickly. 
If you win any money, it is best to get out while you're ahead.
